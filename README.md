**Nuxt 3 Starter** is a boilerplate project designed to kickstart development with Nuxt 3. It comes pre-configured with essential tools and libraries to build modern web applications quickly.

Optimized for performance and flexibility, it already comes with several [Nuxt modules](https://nuxt.com/modules) baked in, such as [Nuxt Image](https://image.nuxt.com/get-started/installation), [ShadCN](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/installation/nuxt), [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/docs/overview/getting-started), Lucide Icons, axios, and Three.js, making it perfect for modern web apps.

This starter aims to provide a solid foundation, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than setting up the basics.
